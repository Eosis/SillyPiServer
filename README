This is a silly server which alternatively tells a raspberry pi to turn something ON and OFF on GPIO Pin 17.

There are numerous prerequisites:
RPi Side:
Python
GPIO library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO
LEDs, Resistors etc... Something to turn ON and OFF!

Server side:
Nodejs

It should then run with:
Server side: 	nodejs main.js
RPi side:		./main.py <hostname>
